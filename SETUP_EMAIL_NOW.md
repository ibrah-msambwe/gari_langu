## ‚ùå TROUBLESHOOTING:

### Problem: npm install resend fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Try with --force
npm install resend --force

# Or clear cache first
npm cache clean --force

```

---

### Problem: .env.local not working

**Check these:**

5. Save in project root: `C:\Users\Administrator_1\Desktop\gari_langu`

---

### Problem: Console shows "RESEND_API_KEY not configured"

2. Verify API key is in the file
3. Stop server (Ctrl+C)
